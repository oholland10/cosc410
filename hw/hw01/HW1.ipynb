    "In this HW you will apply the ML pipeline by using KNN models to predict student exam factors using several different features. Concretely, you will be working with the [Student Performance Factors](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors?resource=download) on Kaggle. \n",

    "1. Preprocess the data and split it into train and test (no need for validation set because we will use k-fold cross-validation). For this homework use 80% of the data for training, and 20% for evaluation. \n",
    "2. Exploring the training data: What are the input features you could use? What features do you want to use and explore? Why? The answers to this can either be theory driven or data-driven. \n",
    "3. Explore different features and hyperparameters with k-fold cross validation. Pick the best model (i.e., feature set and hyperparameter combination)\n",
    "4. Evaluate the best model and discuss the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should structure the code and writing in this notebook in format that makes it easy to follow along with your thought process and argument. \n",

    "#### Questions to answer before you start\n",
    "* Will you use KNN-regression or KNN-classification? Why? \n",
    "* How will you handle non-numerical columns?\n",
    "* You will notice that many of the columns are on different scales. Why is this a problem for KNN models? How can you handle this? "
